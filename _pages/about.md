I'm a research professor in the Department of Psychiatry, CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University School of Medicine.
I finished my Ph.D. in neuroimaging/neuroscience at Yonsei University College of Medicine under the supervision of Professor [Hae-Jeong Park](http://neuroimage.yonsei.ac.kr/). I have been doing data science that integrates medical images and structured/unstructured medical data, and I am also researching brain science and precision psychiatry. Besides, I continuously research new things to contribute to precision medicine in various fields.
