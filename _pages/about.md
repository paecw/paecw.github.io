I'm a research professor in the Department of Psychiatry, CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University School of Medicine.
I finished my Ph.D. in neuroimaging/neuroscience at Yonsei University College of Medicine under the supervision of Professor [Hae-Jeong Park](http://neuroimage.yonsei.ac.kr/). While working as a doctoral researcher, medical physicist, and senior researcher in the Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine at Severance Hospital, I contributed to the automatic diagnosis of medical images in the fields of ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and nuclear medicine. I also studied clinical applications of neuroimage analysis and computational brain modeling for diagnosis and prognosis prediction. Recently, I have been interested in clinical neuroscience and computational psychiatry using artificial intelligence and trying to apply them to precision medicine.
